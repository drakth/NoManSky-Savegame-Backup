# Why?
No Man Sky Savegame Backup, was born because i was annoyed with the bug about the expeditions ending prematurly,
making me waste hours replaying, so I decided to make a small utility to make backups of the savegames as 
changes are detected.

I suppose it could also be used if you want to keep an historic record of your savegames.
